Bug List:

1. isEmpty() returns true on populated lists. It happens with both addFront() and addBack(), so it seems that isEmpty() always returns true. I was thinking it was possible m_size was not incrementing in the add methods, but the size() method was tested and works after adding.

2. addBack() adds elements to the front. Its possible the same code was used in both add methods, with the intentions of changing it later. (copy and pasted as a template, but never changed)

3. removeFront() removes elements from the back. I think the problem is the same idea as the previous bug. (Same code in both methods)

4. both remove methods do not decrease the size after an element is removed.
